          <p>CONNECTIONS is a 7-day intensive workshop program that focuses on the
            connecting power of creative computation. We are seeking collaboration and
            community through our shared practices of open coding, tinkering and making
            art.</p>
          <p>
            During the week, a diverse group of participants will learn together
            and create prototypes.</p>
          <p>
            Throughout the week, FUZZY BINAIRES will facilitate the learning of frameworks
            for creative computation and electronic arts, offering workshops ranging from
            DIY electronics to drawing, games, creative coding and prototyping. As part of
            the workshop activities, participants will be asked to present their own
            artistic practice and discuss possible connections with technology.</p>
          <p>
            On the last day, participants can present their finished or ongoing projects,
            in the form of an experimental popup exhibition and thus invite an interested
            audience to their networks.</p>

            <p>
              The mission of Fuzzy Binaires is to gently bridge the gap between art and
              computation. It is to create the connections necessary to explore how
              practices like computer programming, game development or decentralized
              collaborative sharing can become suitable means of artistic creation.</p>
            <p>Understanding how an algorithm becomes a brush stroke, how sensors transform a space, or how
              procedurally-generated narratives drive a game's experience, is all part of the purpose of becoming a
              Fuzzy Binary: it is exploring the in-betweens and the end-points of the interface between humans and
              computers. Along the way, we will also learn about the ethical implications that technology carries with
              it, and how it is transforming society from an artistic perspective.</p>
            <p>Becoming a Fuzzy Binaire is also about building a community of like-minded
              artists and technologist who enjoy art and coding, about promoting an open and
              positive environment, where ideas are encouraged and where learning is done by
              fostering curiosity and the enjoyment of the process. Finally, it is also
              about creating accessible opportunities and prioritizing the application of
              groups of people often marginalized in the tech industry.</p>

            <!-- <div class="subheading mb-3">Intelitec Solutions</div> -->
            <p>
              With the rise of technology-based frameworks for creative inquiry, the world
              has seen a very diverse, eclectic, and extremely interdisciplinary approach
              towards the creation of artwork. Ideas and practices that date back to the
              1970s are now widespread among a community of art-making individuals, who are
              successfully merging and creating dialogues between their own practice by
              means of the power and language of computational devices.</p>
            <p>For some artist, the idea of needing to learn the technicalities that
              computers entail might be daunting at first. It means learning a new language.
              It means understanding the very complex realm of the digital. It means
              crossing a bridge between the traditional and the future.
              And even for the experienced electronic artist, the umbrella of the
              computerized medium is so intricate and labyrinthian, that it might seem
              intimidating to stay up-to-date with the latest algorithms for anything...!!</p>
